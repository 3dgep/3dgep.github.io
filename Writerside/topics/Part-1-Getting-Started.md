# Part 1: Getting Started

Welcome to the first article in the Programming C++ Fast Track tutorial series! These tutorials are designed to take you from zero to a decent entry level in a somewhat smooth fashion. We start at the absolute basics: all that you need to get started is a laptop or PC, a fair bit of time, and quite a bit of dedication.

## Time Investment

Regarding dedication: These tutorials are supposed to take you anywhere between two and four hours each. Aim to complete a minimum of two tutorials per week. That means that you have an extra workload of 4-8 hours. No-one said this was going to be easy, right?

## About the Authors

This course was originally created for the Games programme at Breda University of Applied Sciences; see https://www.buas.nl/games.

It was recently updated for the students of the Utrecht University as well; see https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/faculty-of-science/education/bachelors-programmes.

This tutorial was written by Jacco Bikker, Brian Beuken, Nils Deslé, and Carlos Bott and updated for Visual Studio 2019 by Robbie Grigg and Phil de Groot and updated and maintained by Jeremiah van Oosten.

## Getting the stuff you need

For the purpose of these tutorials, I will assume you develop your games on PCs. The preferred development environment is Microsoft’s Visual Studio 2019. A free version (the Community Edition) of this software is available from Microsoft, via https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads.

Checklist:

- A PC or laptop, pretty much any CPU and GPU will do
- Windows 11 or 12
- Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition (Professional and Enterprise more than welcome), installed with default settings

> Keep in mind you will want to install Visual Studio and programming projects on your fastest storage device – a super fast Solid State Drive (SSD) is preferred! Some people even go crazy and use RAM disks for their projects. This might not matter now but when you are hitting tens of thousands of Lines of Code (LOCs) it will save you a lot of time.

## Starting Visual Studio

When you start Visual Studio for the first time you are greeted with this window:
